# IIF4J - QuickBooks IIF Generation Library for Java
By Guy Paddock ([guy@redbottledesign.com](mailto:guy@redbottledesign.com))

To my surprise, there were no existing, freely-available, open-source IIF libraries for Java. This
library attempts to fill that void.

This library can be used to write out IIF files that can be imported into QuickBooks 2007 and later
editions.


## Getting Started
Check out `src/test/java/com/redbottledesign/accounting/quickbooks` for some practical examples of
using this library.
